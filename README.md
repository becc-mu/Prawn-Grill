# <h1>The Prawn Grill Blog Wwbpage</h1>
<p>
<strong>It's an a starter for responsive website</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li> This template uses HTML5 semantic, as well as some div elements for responsive layout but you can swap the tags as you wich.</li>
<li> It is a 10-grid system.</li>
<li> It targets common tablet and mobile devices.</li>
<li> The Top menu has collapsable hamberger menu for mobile devices</li>
<li> The Main image and the right side content is not fully adjusted for smaller devices</li>
<li> The main content has filterable grid images with some tabs to filter the images.<li>
<li>The grid is fluid with 3 columns on Tablets and fits on major screens.</li>
<li> On Mobile it shows only 1 column.</li>
<li> It uses FLEXBOX and serves no due delegence for old IEs.</li>
</ul>
<li> The form also works but needs a some tiding and styling</li>
Thanks,<br>
